Your feedback would help us to improve the book.

This book tries to teach undergraduate and graduate students as well as high school students how to program with the Python programming language.
It aims to strike a good balance between theory and practice, leaning more to the practice side.
In particular, we try to teach programming together with some software engineering concepts.
It is the firm opinion of the author that these two cannot be separated.
Teaching programming alone without introducing tools such as static code analysis, unit tests, and enforcing principles such as code style and proper commenting will create bad programmers.
So we discuss these aspects while working our way through the principles of programming.

This book is intended to be read on an electronic device.
Please do not print it.
Help preserving the environment.

This book is work in progress.
It will take years to be completed and I plan to keep improving and extending it for quite some time.

This book is freely available.
You can download its newest version from <https://thomasweise.github.io/programmingWithPython/>.
This version may change since this book is, well, work in progress.
You can freely share this.
You can also copy text or figures, as long as you cite the book as the original source, e.g., by using the following BibTeX:
