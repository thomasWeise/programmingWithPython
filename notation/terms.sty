description={%
The bias is subtracted from the value stored in the \pgls{exponent} field of a floating point number. %
This allows for representing both positive and negative exponents. %
In the 64~bit double precision IEEE~Standard 754 floating point number layout~\cite{IEEE2019ISFFPA,H1997IS7FPN}, the bias is~1023. %

description={%
A very common and simple text format for exchanging tabular or matrix data is \acrfull{CSV}~\cite{S2005CFAMTFCSVCF}. %

The elements in the row are separated by a fixed delimiter, usually a comma~(\inQuotes{,}), sometimes a semicolon~(\inQuotes{;}). %
\python\ offers some out-of-the-box \pgls{CSV} support in the \pythonilIdx{csv}~module~\cite{PSF2024CCFRAW}.%

\newglossaryentry{doctest}{%
name={doctest},%
description={%
\emph{doctests} are small pieces of code in the \pglspl{docstring} that look like interactive \python\ sessions.
The first line of a statement in such a \python\ snippet is indented with \python{>>>}\pythonIdx{>\strut>\strut>} and the following lines by \pythonil{...}\pythonIdx{\idxdots}.
These snippets can be executed by modules like \pythonilIdx{doctest}~\cite{PSF2024DTIPE} or tools such as \pytest~\cite{KPDT2024HTRD}.
Their output is the compared to the text following the snippet in the \pgls{docstring}.
If the output matches this text, the test succeeds.
Otherwise it fails.%

%
\newglossaryentry{exitCode}{%
name={exit code},%
description={%
When a process terminates, it can return a single integer value (the exit status code) to indicate success or failure~\cite{J2024PTOGBSI8IS12EETAP}. %
Per convention, an exit code of~0 means success. %
Any non-zero exit code indicates an error. %
Under \python, you can terminate the current process at any time by calling \pythonilIdx{exit} and optionally passing in the exit code that should be returned. %
If \pythonilIdx{exit} is not explicitly called, then the interpreter will return an exit code of~0 once the process normally terminates.%
If the process was terminated by an uncaught \pythonilIdx{Exception}, a non-zero exit code, usually~1, is returned.%

%
%
\newglossaryentry{exponent}{%
name={exponent},%
description={%
The exponent is the part of a floating point number that stores a power of~2 with which the \pgls{significand} is multiplied. %
This allows for covering a wide range of different precisions and representing both very large and very small numbers. %
In the 64~bit double precision IEEE~Standard 754 floating point number layout~\cite{IEEE2019ISFFPA,H1997IS7FPN}, the exponent is 11~bits with a \pgls{bias} of~1023. %

\newglossaryentry{stackTrace}{%
name={stack trace},%
description={%
A stack trace gives information the way in which one function invoked another. %
The term comes from the fact that the data needed to implement function calls is stored in a stack data structure~\cite{K1997FA}. %
The data for the most recently invoked function is on top, the data of the function that called is right below, the data of the function that called that one comes next, and so on. %
Printing a stack trace can be very helpful when trying to find out where an \pythonilIdx{Exception} occurred, see, for instance, \cref{sec:exceptions,lst:exceptions:use_sqrt_raise}.%

It is the text stream to which the process writes information about errors and exceptions. %
If an uncaught \pythonilIdx{Exception} is raised in \python\ and the program terminates, then this information is written to \pgls{stderr}. %
If you run a program in a \pgls{terminal}, then the text that a process writes to its \pgls{stderr} appears in the console.%

Knowing what a terminal is and how to use it is very essential in any programming- or system administration-related task. %
If you want to open a terminal under \windows, you can \windowsTerminal, as shown, e.g., in \cpageref{fig:installingPythonWindows01openTerminal}. %

plural={type hints},%
description={%
are annotations that help programmers and static code analysis tools such as \mypy\ to better understand what type a variable or function parameter is supposed to be~\cite{PEP484,PEP482}. %
\python\ is a dynamically typed programming language where you do not need to specify the type of, e.g., a variable. %
This creates problems for code analysis, both automated as well as manual: %
For example, it may not always be clear whether a variable or function parameter should be an integer or floating point number. %
The annotations allow us to explicitly state which type is expected. %
They are \emph{ignored} during the program execution. %
They are a basically a piece of documentation. %

description={%
The \acrfull{XML} is a text-based language for storing and transporting of data~\cite{BPSMM2008EMLX1FE,K2019ITXJY,CH2013XFCAMLTMC}. %
It allows you to define elements in the form \textil{<myElement myAttr="x">...text..</myElement>}. %
Different from \pgls{csv}, elements in XML can be hierarchically nested, like~\textil{<a><b><c>test</c></b><b>bla</b></a>}, and thus easily represent tree structures. %
XML is one of most-used data interchange formats. %
To process XML in \python, use the \pythonilIdx{defusedxml} library~\cite{H2021D0XBPFPSM}, as it protects against several security issues.%
