A terminal is a text-based window where you can enter commands and execute them by pressing \keys{\return}. %
Knowing what a terminal is and how to use it is very essential in any programming- or system administration-related task. %
If you want to open a terminal under \windows, you can press \keys{\OSwin + R}, type in \bashil{cmd}, and hit \keys{\return}, as shown, e.g., in \cpageref{fig:installingPythonWindows01openTerminal}. %
Under \ubuntu\ \linux, \keys{\ctrl+\Alt+T} opens a terminal.%
