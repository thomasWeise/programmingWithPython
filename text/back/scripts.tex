\hsection{Scripts}%
%
Here we provide some scripts that are used within this book.
These scripts are written for the \bash\ shell, which is the default interpreter running in \ubuntu\ \linux\ \pglspl{terminal}.
Therefore, they will not work under \windows\ or other operating systems.
Now, our book focuses on \python\ programming, so \bash\ shell scripts are not in the center of our attention.
We here cannot explain how \bash\ scripts work or what their syntax is.
There exist plenty of books and resources on this interesting topic, such as~\cite{NR2005LTBSUSPCB3,Z2017MB,BN2018BC} or \url{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}.
If we would include the scripts in the places where we use them in this book, then this would lead to confusion or tangents in the text which would mess up the flow of chapters.
Nevertheless, the book would be incomplete if these scripts were not provided at all.
So we put them here, at the end of the book, where they do not hurt anyone and where the interested reader may check them out.%
