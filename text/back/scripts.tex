\hsection{Scripts}%

Here we provide some scripts that are used within this book.
The book focuses on \python\ programming, so \bash\ shell scripts are not in the center of our attention and may mess up the flow of chapters.
Nevertheless, the book would be incomplete if these scripts were not provided as well.
So we put them here, at the end of the book.%
