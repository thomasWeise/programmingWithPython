The goal of this book is to teach practical programming with the Python language to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students alike.
Hopefully, readers without prior knowledge can follow the text.
Therefore, all concepts are introduced using examples and discussed comprehensively.
All examples are available online in the GitHub repository associated with this book, so that readers can play with them easily.
Actually, the goal of the book is not just to teach programming, but to teach programming as a part of the software development process.
This means that from the very beginning, we will attempt to push the reader towards writing clean code with comments and documentation as well as to use various tools for finding potential issues.
While this book is work in progress, we hope that it will eventually teach all the elements of Python software creation.
We hope that it can enable readers without prior programming experience to develop beautiful and maintainable software.
