\hsection{Working with the Ecosystem}%
%
A software developer rarely works on a stand-alone project all by themself.
Instead, they develop projects that are part of an ecosystem of applications.
Their programs will usually depend on libraries, i.e., \python\ packages that offer functionality.
Often, their projects are stored in \pglspl{VCS} like \git\ repositories.
In this part of the book, we will take a small glimpse on how to work within a system of existing projects and \pglspl{VCS}.%
