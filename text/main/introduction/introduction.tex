Welcome to \emph{Programming with \python}, an introduction into \python\ programming.
Our book is just one of many books that teach this programming language.
You can find many more in \cref{sec:furtherReading}.
Our focus is on teaching good programming practices right from the start, support by many examples and tools.
And we will use \emph{lots} of examples.
