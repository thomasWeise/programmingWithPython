\hsection{Variables}%

We did already learn different simple types in \python\ as well as basic expressions, such as mathematical formulas or how to work with strings.
We are still relatively far from writing programs, though.
Basically, all we can do is expressions that fit on a single line.

For more complicated computations, we want to store and modify values.
For this purpose, variables exist.%
