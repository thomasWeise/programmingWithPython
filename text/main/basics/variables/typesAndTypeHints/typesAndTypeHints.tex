An example for the types of variables.}%

A variable is basically a name pointing to an object.
Each object has a type and we already learned about several of these datatypes in \cref{sec:simplyDataTypesAndOperations}.
We can obtain the type of an object stored in variable \pythonil{var} by invoking \pythonil{type(var)}\pythonIdx{type}.
\Cref{lst:variables:types} shows a program that does just that and the output of that program is given in \cref{lst:variables:types}.
It is obvious that the type of a variable that holds an integer value is \pythonilIdx{int}, the type of a variable that holds a floating point number is \pythonilIdx{float}, and so on.
There really is not much to say about that.%

\gitPythonAndOutput{\programmingWithPythonCodeRepo}{01_variables}{variable_types_wrong.py}{--args format}{variables:types_wrong}{%
An example for the confusing variable types.}

Well, actually, there is.
You see, when you declare a variable in a language like \pgls{C}, you have to specify its \emph{type}.
You are then permitted to only assign values that have exactly this type to the variable.
In \python, you do not need to specify a type and you can assign whatever you want to a variable.
This has the advantage that the code is shorter (because you do not need to write the type), looks more elegant, and programming becomes easier.
At first glance.
However, there are also problems.
Let's take a look at \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong}.
We declare a variable named \pythonil{int_var} and store the integer~\pythonil{8} in it.
Then we update \pythonil{int_var} by computing \pythonil{int_var = int_var / 3}.
Back in \cref{sec:int}, you learned that the \pythonilIdx{//} operator performs an integer division with an \pythonil{int} result, whereas the division using the \pythonilIdx{/} operator always returns a \pythonil{float}.
This means that our variable \pythonil{int_var} now contains a \pythonil{float}, which is also visible in the output in \cref{exec:variables:types_wrong}.

From the perspective of \python, this is totally fine.
The program executes and the output appears without error.
However, from the perspective of programming, \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong} is \emph{wrong}.
Imagine that this was not just some random example without meaning.
Imagine that this was a part of a really useful program.
Imagine that you got this program from some source and try to understand it.
If you read this program, then you find that a variable named \pythonil{int_var} contains a \pythonil{float}.
This is not forbidden, but when reading the code, it must strike you as odd.

Indeed, there are at least two possible explanations for this:
On the one hand, maybe, the original author of this code mistakenly mixed up the \pythonilIdx{/} operator for the \pythonilIdx{//} (see \cref{bp:intDivision}).
Maybe they wanted to do an integer division and accidentally did a floating point division.
Depending on what the code later on (in our imaginary larger program) does, it could be very hard to find such an error.

On the other hand, maybe, the author fully well wanted to do a floating point division and expected a \pythonil{float} to be stored in \pythonil{int_var}, but chose a misleading name.
Choosing this name, however, can be very dangerous:
What if another programmer continues to work on this code and, based on the variable's name, expects it to contain an \pythonil{int} whereas it actually contains a \pythonil{float}.
This could again lead to all sorts of strange errors later on in her code.

\bestPractice{codeClarity}{The names we use in program code should clearly reflect our intentions.}

If the programmer followed \cref{bp:codeClarity}, then the code would clearly contain a bug, namely a mix-up between the \pythonilIdx{/} operator for the \pythonilIdx{//}.
Regardless of what is true, you will certainly agree that something is wrong with this program.
And most certainly, it was just a small oversight, maybe even just a typo.
Unfortunately, since you are not the author of the program, you do not know what is wrong.
This code will cause some problem down the line.
Many such problems exist in many software projects and they indeed are hard to find~\cite{KCVM2022AESOTRDIPP}.
So here, the lenience of \python\ of allowing us to not specify types comes back to bite us.

Everyone of us makes such mistakes.
It is impossible to completely avoid them.
Luckily, there are two things that we can do to prevent such situations from passing our \inQuotes{quality control}:%
%
\begin{enumerate}%
%
\item Use static type checking tools to find such potential errors in our code.%
%
\item Use type hints to annotate variables with their types to \emph{a)}~make our intention clearer and \emph{b)}~support type checking tools.%
%
\end{enumerate}%
%
And if you are in one of my classes, you better do both.
And now we will learn how to do that.%

%
A first step to avoiding any type-related errors in programs is, ofcourse, careful programming.
The second step is to use tools that check whether your program code contains ambiguities or errors.
In languages like \pgls{C}, the compiler will take care of that for you.

In \python, which allows for dynamic typing and is an interpreted language, we will use a tool like \mypy~\cite{LLHSVRZSJYYMC2024MOSTFP}.
You can install this tool by opening a terminal.
Under \ubuntu, you therefore press \ubuntuTerminal, and under \windows, you \windowsTerminal.
Then type in \bashil{pip install mypy}\pythonIdx{Mypy}\pythonIdx{pip} and hit \keys{\enter}.
The \mypy\ tool will be installed as illustrated in \cref{fig:pipInstallMypy}.

We can now apply the tool to the program from \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong}.
All we have to do is invoke it in the terminal, giving the program to be checked as argument as well as some additional parameters.
In \cref{exec:variables:variable_types_wrong:mypy}, we invoke \bashil{mypy variable_types_wrong.py --no-strict-optional --check-untyped-defs}, where \textil{variable_types_wrong.py} is the (very fitting) name of the program to check.
Indeed, \mypy\ tells us that something dodgy is going on in the fourth line of that program, i.e., \pythonil{int_var = int_var / 3}.
It will fail with an exit code of~\bashil{1}.
Programs usually return~\bashil{0} as exit code if everything went well and some non-zero value if something went wrong.
And wrong it went.

If we instead apply \mypy\ the completely fine (albeit useless) program \cref{lst:variables:types}, it will tell us that there is no error, as illustrated in \cref{exec:variables:variable_types:mypy}.
So we now have one tool at our hands with which we can check our source code for type-related problems.
Notice that this program just checks the source code.
It does not change the code and it does not execute our program.
It just reads in the code and looks for type-related errors.
This will obviously have no impact on the programs performance or speed.
It also cannot fix the errors, as it cannot what the programmer actually intended to do.
But knowing that line~4 in \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong} is probably wrong will help the programmer to fix that error or oversight before passing the program on to someone else.%
%
\bestPractice{staticTypeChecking}{Every program should pass static type checking with tools such as \mypy. %
Any issue found by the tools should be fixed. %
In other words, type check the program. %
If there is an error, fix the error and \emph{type check it again}. %
Repeat this until no errors are found anymore.%
}%
%
\endhsection%
%
\hsection{Type Hints}%
%
When we discussed \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong} in \cref{sec:typesAndConfusion}, we stated that there could be two reasons for the error in the code:
Either, the author accidentally mixed-up two datatypes or operators~(\pythonilIdx{/}~vs.~\pythonilIdx{//}) or they chose a misleading name for their variable~\pythonil{int_var}.
The problem that any type checking tool faces is that it cannot know the intention of the programmer.
It can find that line~4 four is probably wrong, because the variable \pythonil{int_var}, which former contained an~\pythonil{int}, now gets a \pythonil{float} value assigned to it.

Oddly enough, the problem of guessing the intention of the programmer does not exist in a statically typed language like~pgls{C}.
Here, we \emph{need} to define the type of every variable before assigning a value to it.
Therefore, if the programmer would have wanted \pythonil{int_var} to strictly be an integer, they would have declared it as an integer variable.
If they wanted to store \pythonils{float} in it, they would have declared it as a \pythonil{float} variable.
The compiler would have seen any malpractice right away and could tell us that either line~4 is wrong or our initial assignment of an \pythonil{int} to the variable in line~1.

This is where the dynamic typing and lenience of \python\ comes back to bite us.
It is very convenient for small projects, but as soon as the projects get bigger, it creates a mess.
Remember that \inQuotes{real programs} are much more complex than \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong}.
Imagine wading through thousands of lines of code to figure out what type a variable has, and, while doing so, remember that \python\ permits overwriting the contents of a variable with objects of an entirely different type whenever it pleases us.

Realizing that dynamic typing can be a blessing but also a problem, \emph{optional} type hints were introduced into the \python\ language~\cite{PEP484,R2023PTHATCPBNI}.
We can now declare the type of a variable if we want.
This solves the above problem basically entirely and allows us to tell type checking tools our intention.

When we declare and assign a variable, \pythonil{my_var = 1} for example, and want to define it as integer variable, for example, we simply write \pythonil{my_var: int = 1}.
Of course, a type checker will already see that \pythonil{my_var} should be an integer variable when we assign the integer~\pythonil{1} to it.
However, by writing \pythonil{: int}\pythonIdx{:} after its name, we also clearly establish our intention.
And this makes a difference.

If the author of \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong} had used type hints, they could have written their program differently, as illustrated in \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong_hints_1,lst:variables:types_wrong_hints_2}.
Both programs as well as the original one produce exactly the same output if we execute them with the \python\ interpreter, since type hints are ignored by the interpreter.
However, if we type-check them with \mypy, we get two different results, namely \cref{exec:variables:variable_types_wrong_hints_1:mypy,exec:variables:variable_types_wrong_hints_2:mypy}, respectively.

In \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong_hints_1}, we annotate \pythonil{int_var} as an integer variable by writing \pythonil{int_var: int}.
While the name of the variable already indicates that we want it to hold integers, we now have formally specified this intention.
The \mypy\ type checker tells is in \cref{exec:variables:variable_types_wrong_hints_1:mypy} basically the same as it stated In \cref{exec:variables:variable_types_wrong:mypy}, namely that assigning a \pythonil{float} to this variable is wrong.

However, if the intention of the author wanted that the variable could hold either an \pythonil{int} or a \pythonil{float}, they could have annotated with the type hint \pythonil{int | float}.
The \pythonil{|}\pythonIdx{\textbar!type hints} here is not the \inQuotes{bit-wise or} we learned back in \cref{sec:int:bitstrings}, but instead indicates that both \pythonils{int} and \pythonils{float} are acceptable values for a variable.\footnote{%
Technically speaking, the type hint specification in PEP484~\cite{PEP484} allows all variables annotated with \pythonil{float} to also accept \pythonil{int} values in section \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/\#the-numeric-tower}{The Numeric Tower}. %
Thus annotating the variable only with \pythonil{: float} would have been sufficient. %
However, since \pythonil{int} is actually not a subclass of \pythonil{float} in \python, this can be confusing in some cases. %
Writing \pythonil{int | float} gives me the opportunity to introduce the \pythonil{|}~operator {\dots} so this is how we do it.%
}
This annotation is used in \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong_hints_2}.
A side-effect of using this type is that, when writing this code, its author would have realized that the name \pythonil{int_var} would not be an appropriate name.
They would probably have used something like \pythonil{my_var} instead.
Applying \mypy\ to this program yields the output \cref{exec:variables:variable_types_wrong_hints_2:mypy}, which indicates that everything is OK.

Using type hints together with type checking would have prevented the problems in \cref{lst:variables:types_wrong} from the start.
Either, its author would have discovered the mistake of computing a \pythonil{float} value instead of an \pythonil{int}.
Or they would have more clearly communicated their intention by marking the variable to either hold an \pythonil{int} or a \pythonil{float}.
And this comes at no cost at all when executing the program, because type hints are only checked by programmers and tools, but not by the interpreter.

\bestPractice{typeHints}{Always use type hints.}%

A variant of \cref{lst:variables:types} which has been improved by adding type annotations.}%

The results of static type checking with \mypy\ of the program given in \cref{lst:variables:types_hints}.}

For the sake of completeness, let us also annotate \cref{lst:variables:types} with type hints as a small exercise.
The variable \pythonil{int_var}, in which we want to store the integer value~\pythonil{8}, will be annotated with \pythonil{: int}.
The variable \pythonil{float_var}, in which we want to store the floating point number~\pythonil{3.0}, will be annotated with \pythonil{: float}.
The variable \pythonil{str_var}, in which we want to store the string~\pythonil{"float_var=3.0"}, will be annotated with \pythonil{: str}.
The variable \pythonil{bool_var}, in which we want to store the value~\pythonil{False}, will be annotated with \pythonil{: bool}.
And, finally, the variable \pythonil{none_var}, in which we want to store \pythonil{None}, will be annotated with \pythonil{: None}.
This produces \cref{lst:variables:types_hints}, which we can check with \mypy\ and obtain \cref{exec:variables:variable_types_hints:mypy}.

It is very obvious at this point that including the type of the variable in the variable name is no needed.
It is not helpful for any tool.
If we want to convey our intention about the type to another programmer who may be reading our code, then type hints are a much better choice.
Different from variable names, they also can be interpreted by type checkers.

With type hints, we have brought the advantages of a statically typed programming language to \python.
Since they are optional, a programmer can choose whether and where to use them.
However, if you are a student attending one of my courses, consider them as mandatory.
Their advantage is that they allow us to find many (though by far not all) logical errors.
They make the code easier to read and easier to understand.
Therefore, from my perspective, \cref{bp:typeHints} \emph{always} applies.%
