We now want to write and execute our very first \python\ program.
This program should just print \inQuotes{Hello World!} to the \pgls{stdout} and then exit.
It therefore will consist of the single statement \pythonil{print("Hello World!")} in file \programUrl{very_first_program}, as illustrated in \cref{lst:very_first_program}.

In \pycharm, we usually will not just create a single \python\ source code file.
Instead, we will work in the context of \emph{projects}, which can contain many \python\ files, settings, build scripts, and other resources.
Inside such a project, we would create the \python\ file, write our source code from \cref{lst:very_first_program} into it, and then run it.
The steps for doing this are illustrated with screenshots in \cref{fig:veryFirstProgramA}.

Since we started with a completely new \pycharm\ installation in \cref{sec:installingPyCharm}, no project has yet been created.
So when we open \pycharm, we will arrive at the project creation screen illustrated in \cref{fig:firstProgram01createPycharmProject}.
Here, we will \menu{New Project}, which takes us to the second project creation screen shown in \cref{fig:firstProgram02createPyCharmProjectData}.
In case that you already had \pycharm\ installed and already created some projects in the past, you can get to the same screen by clicking \menu{\pycharmMainMenu > File > New Project}.
Either way, when arriving at the screen, you will find several confusingly looking options.
First, make sure that \menu{Pure Python} is selected in the left pane.
Then you can choose a name for the project in the \menu{Name:} text box.
For the sake of our example, let's call the new project \directory{veryFirstProject}.

Below the name text box, you can select the destination directory in which the project folder should be created in the \menu{Location:} box.
In the screenshot, I have cropped out the directory path to avoid confusion.
You will need to use a different location and paths also look different on \linux\ and \microsoftWindows.
So you will choose some suitable directory on your computer.
However, you may choose the same project name -- \directory{veryFirstProject} -- \emph{inside} your chosen directory.
This name will then become a new folder and this folder will contain all the project files.

The following options may not make any sense for you, which is totally OK for now.
Please make sure to select \menu{Interpreter Type: > Custom Environment} as well as \menu{Environment: > Select existing} and \menu{Type: > Python}.
Under \menu{Python Path:}, you would choose the \python\ interpreter you have installed on your system (see \cref{sec:installingPython}).
On my system that was \inQuotes{\python~3.12.3} at the time of this writing.\footnote{%
Now I am using~\python~\pythonVersion, but this is not important.}
We finally click \menu{Create}.
We now have created our first and empty \pycharm\ \python\ project -- as illustrated in \cref{fig:firstProgram03pycharmProjectCreated}.

We can now create the \python\ file to write our actual program code.
To do this, we right-click on the folder \directory{veryFirstProject} in our \menu{Project} tree view pane on the left-hand side (see \cref{fig:firstProgram04createPythonFile}).
In the menu that pops up, we select and click \menu{New > Python File}.
This takes us the \menu{New Python file} creation dialog illustrated in \cref{fig:firstProgram05createPythonFileEnterName}.
Here, we enter the name for our first program as shown in \cref{fig:firstProgram06createPythonFileNameEntered}.
What could be more fitting than \directory{very\_first\_program}?
After hitting \keys{Enter}, the file is created in our project folder and opened in the editor pane, as shown in \cref{fig:firstProgram07pythonFileCreated}.

We now enter the single line of code from \cref{lst:very_first_program} into the editor, as illustrated in \cref{fig:firstProgram08writeHelloWorld}.
We do not need to explicitly save the file, as \pycharm\ does this automatically for us.

Finally, we want to actually execute, i.e., run, our program.
We can do this directly from the editor by pressing \keys{\ctrl + \shift + F10}.
We can also do it by right-clicking on the file in the project tree view on the left-hand side and then clicking \menu{Run `very\_first\_program'} in the popup menu, as shown in \cref{fig:firstProgram09runProgram}.

Either way, a console with the title \inQuotes{very\_first\_program} opens at the bottom of our editor.
And behold:
Indeed, the text \bashil{Hello World!} appears.

Well, before that text, we see the command line that was actually executed, namely the \python\ interpreter with our file's path as parameter, as illustrated in \cref{fig:firstProgram10programResult}.
And after our program's output, we are notified that \inQuotes{Process finished with \pgls{exitCode}~0,} which means that the program has completed successfully and without error.

Congratulations.
You now have written, saved, and executed your first ever \python\ program!%
