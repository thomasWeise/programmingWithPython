\hsection{Installing Python}%
\label{sec:installingPython}%
In order to learn and use \python, we first need to install it.
There are two major versions of \python\ out there: \python~\softwareStyle{2} and \python~\softwareStyle{3}.
This book focuses entirely on \python~\softwareStyle{3}.
We assume that you have installed \pythonWithVersion\ or newer.
We here provide some brief setup instructions.
More help can be found at the following resources:%
%
\begin{itemize}%
\item the official \python\ setup and usage page~\furtherReading{PSF:P3D:PSAU},%
\item the \python\ Downloads at~\url{https://www.python.org/downloads}, and%
\item the \python~3 Installation \& Setup Guide at~\url{https://realpython.com/installing-python}.%
