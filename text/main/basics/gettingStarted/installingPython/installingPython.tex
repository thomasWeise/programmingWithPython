\hsection{Installing Python}%
In order to learn and use \python, we first need to install it.
There are two major versions of \python\ out there: \python~\softwareStyle{2} and \python~\softwareStyle{3}.
Our course focuses entirely on \python~\softwareStyle{3}.
We assume that you have installed \pythonWithVersion\ or newer.
Hopefully, you could figure out how to do that by yourself -- but we will at least provide some quick guide here as well.
Help can be found at the following resources:%

\begin{itemize}%
\item Python Downloads at \url{https://www.python.org/downloads/}%
\item the Python 3 Installation \& Setup Guide at \url{https://realpython.com/installing-python/}%
