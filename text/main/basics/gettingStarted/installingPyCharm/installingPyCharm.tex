Just having a programming language and the corresponding interpreter on your system is not enough.
Are you going to write programs in a simple text editor like a caveperson?
No, of course not, you need an \gls{IDE}, a program which allows you to do multiple of the necessary tasks involved in the software development process under one convenient user interface.
For this course, we recommend using \pycharm, whose community edition is freely available.
The installation guide for \pycharm\ can be found at \url{https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html}.%
