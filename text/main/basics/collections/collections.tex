\hsection{Collection Types}%
%
We already learned about simple datatypes, like integer and floating point numbers, strings, and Boolean values.
We also learned how we can use variables to store instances (objects) of such datatypes.
However, in many cases, we do not just want to store a single object.
Often, we want to store and process \emph{collections} of objects~\cite{PSF2024BIT,PSF2024DM,PSF2024CAABCFC}.%
