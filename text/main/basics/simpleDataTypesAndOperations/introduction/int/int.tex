Integer arithmetic is the very first thing that you learn in mathematics in primary school.
Integer arithmetic is also the very first thing you learn here.
\emph{Integer} is a Latin word that means \inQuotes{whole} or \inQuotes{intact.}
The integers include all whole numbers and negative numbers and zero, without fractions and decimals.

In many programming languages, there are different integer datatypes with different ranges.
In \softwareStyle{Java}, a \pythonil{byte} is an integer datatype with range~\intRange{-2^7}{2^7-1}, a \pythonil{short} has range~\intRange{-2^{15}}{2^{17}-1}, an \pythonil{int} has range~\intRange{-2^{31}}{2^{31}-1}, and \pythonil{long} has range~\intRange{-2^{63}}{2^{63}-1}, for example.
The draft for the \softwareStyle{C17} standard for the \softwareStyle{C}~programming language lists five signed and five unsigned integer types, plus several ways to extend them~\cite{ISOIEC207PLCWDOS}.
